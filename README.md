## Vignette Abstract

This vignette utilizes a combination of machine learning techniques, including Isolation Forests and classical time series models to analyze and predict potential anomalies and trends in several datasets, showcasing their wide range of applications. By identifying irregularities in data, businesses and companies can identify problems, use model results to employ effective solutions, and forecast trends to prepare for any issues.

## Repository Contents

data - a folder containing the raw and preprocessed datasets used for our methods

scripts - a folder containing separate Jupyter notebooks and Python files used

vignette-anomaly.ipynb - the primary vignette document, which is a combined Jupyter notebook containing all integrated code, results, and analyses. This document also functions as a script with line annotations that replicates all the results shown, assuming that the user's environment have the datasets loaded properly

Vignette_Presentation.pdf - a PowerPoint presentation of the Vignette ideas, analyses, results, and applications
